The distance of this ring from the reference pixel is set by the <em>ring_size_factor</em> parameter.

First Caiman convolves the motion corrected movie with a <i>mean-centered Gaussian</i> (example to the right). The sigma of the Gaussian is <em>gSig</em>, and mean centering is turned on by setting <em>center_psf</em> to <em>True</em>. This mean centering creates a Gaussian with a positive peak in the middle of width <i>approximately</i> <em>gSig/2</em>, surrounded by a negative trench, and a ledge of zeros around the outer edges. This crucial preprocessing filter serves to highlight neuronal peaks and smooth away low-frequency background activity.\n","\n","<p>The function <em>correlation_pnr()</em> applies this mean-centered Gaussian to each frame of the motion corrected movie and returns the correlation image of that movie, as well as the peak-to-noise-ratio (PNR). The correlation image is the correlation of each pixel with its neighbors. The PNR is the ratio of the maximum magnitude at a pixel to the noise value at that pixel (it is a fast and rough measure of signal-to-noise). As mentioned above, both of these values tend to be higher in pixels that contain neurons. The CNMFE initialization procedure is to set a threshold for both quantities, take their <i>product</i>, and use the peaks in this product map to find <b>seed pixels</b> for initialization of the CNMFE source separation algorithm.</p>\n","\n","More details on the initialization procedure used here can be found in the <a href=\"https://elifesciences.org/articles/28728\">CNMFE paper</a>, or by exploring the code.         \n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uD4vYOy4nmU5"},"source":["### Evaluate our spatial parameters\n","As discussed in `demo_pipeline.ipynb`, the other important parameters are those used for dividing the movie into patches for parallelization of the algorithm.
